Official implementation of the **ECCV 2024** paper **Asynchronous Large Language Model Enhanced Planner for Autonomous Driving**.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

#### Step 1: Download NuPlan Dataset

- Follow the [official instructions](https://nuplan-devkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dataset_setup.html) to download the NuPlan dataset.

#### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

Make sure to set the following environment variables correctly to point to the NuPlan datase:

```
NUPLAN_MAPS_ROOT=path/to/nuplan/dataset/maps
NUPLAN_DATA_ROOT=path/to/nuplan/dataset
NUPLAN_EXP_ROOT=path/to/nuplan/exp
```

#### Step 3: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/memberRE/AsyncDriver.git && cd AsyncDriver
```

#### Step 4: Set up the Conda Environment

- **Create the NuPlan Environment:**

  Create a Conda environment based on the provided `environment.yml` file:

  ```
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  ```

- **Install Additional Dependencies:**

  After setting up the Conda environment, install the additional dependencies listed in the `requirements_asyncdriver.txt`:

  ```
  pip install -r requirements_asyncdriver.txt
  ```

  > *Note:* If you encounter any issues with dependencies, refer to the `environment_all.yaml` for a complete list of packages.

#### Step 5: Download Checkpoints and AsyncDriver Dataset 

- Download the [**PDM checkpoint**](https://github.com/autonomousvision/tuplan_garage), and update the necessary file paths in the configuration (although this checkpoint is not actively used in the current version).
- Download the [**llama-2-13b-chat-hf**](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf).
- Download the [training data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Member22335/AsyncDriver/resolve/main/stage1_train_180k_processed.json) and [validate data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Member22335/AsyncDriver/resolve/main/stage1_val_20k_processed.json) and update the `map_info` field in the JSON files to the corresponding file's absolute path.

### 2. Evaluation

To evaluate the model, use the following command:

~~~
bash train_script/inference/asyncdriver_infer.sh <gpuid> <scenario_type_id>
~~~

> `<scenario_type_id>` is a value between [0-13], representing 14 different scenario types. Replace all `path/to` placeholders in the scripts with actual paths.

To evaluate the model with asynchronous inference, use:

~~~
bash train_script/inference/with_interval.sh <gpuid> <scenario_type_id> <interval>
~~~

> `<interval>` defines the inference interval between LLM and Real-time Planner, and it should be set to a value between [0, 149].

To evaluate the model with `pdm_scorer`, use:

~~~
bash train_script/inference/with_pdm_scorer.sh <gpuid> <scenario_type_id>
~~~


> *Note:* Update `nuplan/planning/script/config/simulation/planner/llama4drive_lora_ins_wo_stop_refine.yaml` at line 58 with the correct PDM checkpoint path. This path is required for instantiation but is not used during execution.

If you encounter issues with the planner not being found, modify the following line:

- Change `train_script/inference/simulator_llama4drive.py` from line 83 to line 84.

Training checkpoints is available for [download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17TLnwgp7T6ke67kgSqnc2dhTCZn83W6a/view?usp=drive_link).


### 3. Evaluation with TensorRT and ONNX

#### Step 1: Export the ONNX File

Run the following command to export the merged LoRA model to ONNX:

```bash
python export_onnx.py \
  --model_path /path/to/base_model \
  --lora_path /path/to/lora_model \
  --onnx_path /path/to/output_model.onnx
```

#### Step 2: Convert ONNX to TensorRT

Navigate to the converter directory, compile the binary, and generate the TensorRT engine:

```bash
cd onnx_to_tensorrt
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./onnx_to_tensorrt /path/to/model.onnx /path/to/model.engine
```

#### Step 3: Modify Inference Script

Edit the script `train_script/inference/asyncdriver_infer.sh` and configure the following variables:

- `onnx_model_path`: path to the exported ONNX model.
- `tensorrt_model_path`: path to the generated TensorRT engine.
- `inference_model_type`: one of `torch`, `onnx`, or `tensorrt`.

#### Step 4: Run Evaluation

Follow the steps in [Section 2: Evaluation](#2-evaluation) to run model inference using the configured backend.

#### Performance on NVIDIA Jetson Orin

The table below compares the inference times of the LoRA-finetuned LLaMA component within AsyncDriver on Jetson Orin across different inference backends and precisions:

| Inference Method            | Time (s) |
|-----------------------------|---------:|
| PyTorch (FP16)              |   0.3250 |
| ONNX Runtime (FP16)         |   0.1265 |
| ONNX Runtime (FP32)         |   0.1960 |
| TensorRT (FP16)             |   0.1016 |
| TensorRT (FP32)             |   0.2149 |

### 4. Training

The training process involves multiple stages:

- **Train GameFormer:**

~~~
python train_script/train_gameformer.py --train_set path/to/stage1_train_180k_processed.json --valid_set stage1_val_20k_processed.json
~~~

- **Train Planning-QA:**

~~~
bash train_script/train_qa/train_driveqa.sh <gpu_ids>
~~~

- **Train Reasoning1K:**

~~~
bash train_script/train_qa/train_mixed_desion_qa.sh <gpu_ids>
~~~

- **Final stage:**

~~~
bash train_script/train_from_scratch/llm_load_pretrain_lora_gameformer.sh <gpu_ids>
~~~

> *Note:* Make sure to replace all `path/to` placeholders in the scripts with actual paths.
